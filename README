# pyspeakrec
Python app that lets you create, use and edit a functioning deep learning speaker recognition system.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The following describes installation instructions for both Mac and Windows systems.

#### Mac (UNIX)

    $ git clone https://github.com/AKBoles/pyspeakrec.git
    $ cd pyspeakrec/
    $ pip install -r setup.txt --user
    
#### Windows 10

First, check installation of python on Windows 10 by opening up a command prompt and typing `python` and seeing which version is installed. If it is `Python3.5.2` then you can continue the installation. If it is not, follow instructions on how to upgrade python on a Windows system, found at [Python3.5-Windows](https://github.com/AKBoles/Installation-Documentation/blob/master/Python3-Windows10.md).

Next, install Git for Windows by following the instructions on [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/).

Following this installation launch `Git bash` and clone this repository by typing the following command:

    $ git clone https://github.com/AKBoles/pyspeakrec.git
    $ cd pyspeakrec/
    $ pip install -r setup.txt --user

### Troubleshooting

#### Mac (UNIX)

If problems occur with the Mac installation, run the following commands to try and fix it.

    $ xcode-select --install
    $ pip install --global-option='build_ext' --global-option='-I/usr/local/include' --global-option='-L/usr/local/lib' pyaudio --user
    $ pip install librosa --user
    $ brew install portaudio
    
If the installation of `portaudio` gives an error, install from source by doing: 

    $ git clone https://github.com/jleb/pyaudio.git
    $ cd pyaudio/
    $ python setup.py install

Additionally, check for updates (and update if there are) in `pip` by using:
    
    $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip

#### Windows 10

Check for updates (and update if there are) in `pip` by using:

    $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
